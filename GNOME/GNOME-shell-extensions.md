# GNOME shell extensions

The official site of GNOME shell extensions is [https://extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/), you can search for and install the extensions you want here.

### Manage

You can use "gnome-tweak-tool" to manage your shell extensions. Run ```sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool``` in terminal to install it. All your installed extensions can be seen in the "extension" tab.

### Install

If you want to install extensions directly from the website, you should get a native nost connector first.

You will be asked to install a FireFox extension called GNOME Shell integration if you install GNOME extensions from the website by FireFox.

If you use Chrome, there is a similar extension. And you can also get it using command ``sudo apt-get install chrome-gnome-shell``.
