# GNOME shell extensions

The official site of GNOME shell extensions is [https://extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/), you can search for and install the extensions you want here.

### Manage

You can use "gnome-tweak-tool" to manage your shell extensions. Run 

```
sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool
sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions
```

in terminal to install it. All your installed extensions can be seen in the "extension" tab.

### Install

If you want to install extensions directly from the website, you should get a "native host connector" first.

On FireFox, the native host connector is an extension called GNOME Shell integration. You will be asked to install it if you install GNOME extensions from the website by FireFox.

If you use Chrome, there is a similar extension. And you can also get it using command ``sudo apt-get install chrome-gnome-shell``.

After you get the native host extension, you can install whatever extensions you want by simply click the "on" button. (You can also turn the extension off this way)
