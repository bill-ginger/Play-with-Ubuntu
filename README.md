This is a repository to record my experience in configuring and using Ubuntu as a daily productive OS.

### Setting up

- Modify gnome theme and beautify

- Plugins and extentions

### Hard Drive

- [Install firmware for Intel SSD P3600](https://github.com/bill-ginger/Play-with-Ubuntu/blob/master/Intel-SSD-firmware/Install-driver-for-P3600.md)

- Rescue data from a HDD drive

- Rescue /boot partition as the Windows SSD died

### Network

- [Use remmina to connect to Windows server](https://github.com/bill-ginger/Play-with-Ubuntu/blob/master/remmina/Remmina-connecting-Winserver-issue.md)

- Open Wifi hotspot after booting automatically

- Proxy settings(for shell, git, snap, anaconda)

### Scripts for fun

- [A bash script to see the power consumption of CPU and GPU](https://github.com/bill-ginger/Play-with-Ubuntu/blob/master/read-core-power/read-core-power.md)

- [A python script to see how much time has passed in the year/week/day](https://github.com/bill-ginger/Play-with-Ubuntu/blob/master/howlong.py)
